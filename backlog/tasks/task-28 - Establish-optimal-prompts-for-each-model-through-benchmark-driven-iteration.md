## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Our goal is to establish prompts for each of the models that we are working with that has optimal results for our tasks. Validate by improved benchmarks.

Context:
- This is the ultimate goal of the agent specialist system
- Model-specific prompt optimization
- Benchmark-driven validation of improvements
- Continuous refinement process

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Optimal prompts identified for each model type
- [ ] #2 Benchmarks show measurable improvements over baseline
- [ ] #3 Model-specific optimizations documented
- [ ] #4 Results validated through benchmark scores
- [ ] #5 Final prompts packaged as versioned templates
